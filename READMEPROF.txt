I had a lot trouble trying to get this code to compile
I was able to use an online compiler and get it to properly function and was able to test on there. I used https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_fortran_compiler
I talked to other classmates and they were having issues compiling as well. 
The code wasnt hard to implement. It was getting it to run. I still wasnt able to get output on here, but I did find a compiler on windows that worked. However, I was too scared to change my github location due to the issues I was having with prolog
